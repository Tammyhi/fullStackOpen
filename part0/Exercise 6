    Note right of browser: Before the new note is sent to the server these following steps occured:
                           1. The user clicks the form's submit button
                           2. The page's form element is fetched
                           3. An event handler is called to handle the form's submit event, overriding the default handling
                           4. The event handler creates a new note, adds it to the list of notes, renders it on the page and sends the new note to the server
